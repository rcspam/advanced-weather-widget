"""Make contents/ui/components/vendor/night-lights.bin, the lights of the
towns the radar map lights on the night side, as points.

Input: NASA Earth Observatory, Black Marble 2016, grey, 3 km
(BlackMarble_2016_3km_gray.jpg, 13500 x 6750, equirectangular from 90N and
180W, public domain), https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NightLights

Each cell of the picture brighter than FLOOR becomes a point with a chance
that grows with its brightness, ((v - FLOOR) / (255 - FLOOR)) ** POWER,
drawn from a fixed seed: every cell of a town centre, a scatter of points
over the countryside. Packed as WidgetEarth.decodeNightLights()
(glue-earth.js) reads them:
  "AWN1", u16 columns and u16 rows of the grid, u32 point count (little
  endian), then per point, row by row and left to right: varint rows down
  from the point before, varint columns across (from the point before in
  the same row, from column 0 on a new row), the brightness byte.
